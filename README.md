# 🎨 AI Image Editor (Tkinter + OpenCV) — HIT137 Assignment 3

A clean, professional **desktop image editor** built with **Python (Tkinter GUI + OpenCV image processing)**.  
It follows the HIT137 requirements and includes a modern dark UI, undo/redo history, and adjustable sliders for effects.

---

##  Key Features (As Required)

This app includes **all 8 required image editing features**:

-  **Grayscale conversion**
-  **Gaussian Blur (Adjustable slider)**
-  **Edge Detection (Canny)**
-  **Brightness adjustment (Adjustable slider)**
-  **Contrast adjustment (Adjustable slider, 0–200)**
-  **Rotation** (90°, 180°, 270°)
-  **Flip** (Horizontal / Vertical)
-  **Resize / Scale** by percentage (10% – 200%)



---

##  User Interface Highlights

- **Modern dark theme**
- **Colorful heading + “real app” look**
- **Scrollable left sidebar** (works well on smaller screens)
- Clean slider labels (professional UI, no messy default Tk numbers)
- Centered welcome screen when no image is loaded
- Status bar showing:
  - file name  
  - image size  
  - undo/redo availability  
  - last action taken

##  OOP Design (HIT137 Requirement)

This project demonstrates strong OOP structure using multiple classes:

- `ImageEditorApp` → Handles GUI, user events, rendering, and workflow
- `ImageProcessor` → Handles all OpenCV image operations (filters + transformations)
- `HistoryManager` → Manages **Undo/Redo** states using stacks (clean and memory-limited)

This separation makes the project:
- easier to understand  
- easier to maintain  
- aligned with professional software design
