# AI Image Editor

## HIT137 – Software Now | Group Assignment 3

### Project Overview

This project is a desktop image editing application developed for HIT137 – Software Now (Group Assignment 3).
The application demonstrates practical understanding of:

1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. Tkinter GUI development
3. Image processing using OpenCV
4. Version control and collaboration using GitHub

The focus of the project is to build a clean, user-friendly application while maintaining good software design, modular code structure, and readability.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

Python 3
- Tkinter – Graphical User Interface
- OpenCV (cv2) – Image processing
- NumPy – Image data manipulation
- Pillow (PIL) – Image rendering for Tkinter
- GitHub – Version control and collaboration

## 🎯 Application Features
### 🖼 Image Processing (OpenCV)

The application supports the following image operations:

1. Grayscale conversion
2. Gaussian blur (adjustable intensity)
3. Edge detection (Canny algorithm)
4. Brightness adjustment
5. Contrast adjustment
6. Image rotation (90°, 180°, 270°)
7. Image flip (horizontal / vertical)
8. Resize / scale by percentage

All image processing logic is handled in a dedicated processing class, keeping the GUI code clean and maintainable.

## 🧩 Graphical User Interface (Tkinter)

The GUI includes all required elements:

Main application window with proper sizing

### Menu bar:

- File → Open, Save, Save As, Exit
- Edit → Undo, Redo
- Image display area using a Canvas
- Control panel with buttons and sliders
- Live slider previews for blur, brightness, and contrast

### Status bar displaying:

- File name
- Image dimensions
- Undo / Redo availability
- Last performed action
- Message boxes for errors, confirmations, and warnings

## 🧠 Object-Oriented Design

The application is structured using multiple classes to clearly demonstrate OOP principles:

### Key Classes

### ImageEditorApp
Manages the GUI and user interactions

### ImageProcessor
Handles all OpenCV image processing logic

### HistoryManager
Manages undo and redo functionality

### OOP Concepts Demonstrated

- Classes and objects
- Constructors
- Instance and class attributes
- Encapsulation
- Method-based class interaction
- Clear separation of responsibilities

## How to Run the Application

### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

### 2️⃣ Run the Application
python main.py

## 👥 Group Work & GitHub Usage

The project is maintained in a public GitHub repository

- All group members are added as collaborators
- Commits show continuous development from start to submission
- GitHub is used to track progress, collaboration, and contributions
- The repository link is provided in github_link.txt as required.

## 📝 Notes

- Supported image formats: JPG, PNG, BMP
- Images are processed internally using OpenCV (BGR format)
- Conversion to RGB is done only for display in Tkinter
- Undo / Redo allows safe experimentation with image edits
- Code is documented with clear, human-readable docstrings and comments

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete Python desktop application that integrates GUI development, image processing, and object-oriented programming principles.
The focus was on producing clean, readable, and maintainable code while delivering all required functionality in a user-friendly interface.
